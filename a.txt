Write a program that calculates the slope between two coordinates: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). The program should take four decimal inputs from the user, in the order of x1, x2, y1, y2. Then print the slope.

Note: slope formula looks like this:

Sample run:

Enter the first x-coordinate:
3.9
Enter the second x-coordinate:
5.1
Enter the first y-coordinate:
4.8
Enter the second y-coordinate:
1.2
Slope: -3.0000000000000004
