Write code that asks for a positive integer n, then prints 3 random integers from 2 to n+2 inclusive using Math.random().

Note #1: In the starter code for this exercise the line "import testing.Math;" appears. You should not remove this line from your code as it is required to correctly grade your code. Also make sure that your code outputs exactly 3 numbers (be particularly careful there aren't any extra numbers in your prompt for user input).

Note #2: Make sure your minimum output is 2 or more, and make sure your maximum output is only up to n + 2 (so if user inputs 5, the maximum output should only be 7).

Hint: Knowing your PEMDAS will help a lot.

Sample Run:
Enter a positive integer:
6
7
2
5
